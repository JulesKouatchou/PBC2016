#Global Land-Ocean Temperature Index (C) (Anomaly with Base: 1951-1980)

We want to reproduce the Global Land-Ocean Temperature Index plot 
available at this GISS website:

     http://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/graphs_v3/

The temperature anomaly data are in the file:

     Global_Land-Ocean_TempIndex.txt

(obtained from http://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/graphs_v3/Fig.A2.txt)
Note that there are missing data.

Here are the steps:

  1- Write a function that read the file and populate the three lists:
     years, annualMeanTemp and fiveYearMean. 
  2- Find ways to take into account the missing values while filling 
     annualMeanTemp and fiveYearMean.
  3- Convert the three lists into Numpy arrays and create masks to 
     identify the missing data.
  4- Use Matplotlib to plot the data. 

We propose two possible solutions:

  1- Long  Solution: PBC2016_sol_analyzeTempData_1.py
     Write a function that does the normal reading of the data
     and include Python statements to skip header lines and 
     identify missing values. In addition mask the data to not
     include missing values.

  2- Short Solution: PBC2016_sol_analyzeTempData_2.py
     Use a Numpy function to reads the file and automatically
     skips the header lines and handles the missing values.
