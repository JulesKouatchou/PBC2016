GSFC Python Boot Camp 2016
--------------------------

Presentation on Python Matpolotlib Basemap
------------------------------------------

Friday 17 June 2016 - Presenter: Peter Hall
----------------------------------------------

For this section you will need :

1. i.)  A text editor you know how to use.
        (Emacs, Vi, Edit, etc.)
   ii.) A graphics file viewer you know how to use.
        (EOG, ImageMagick, etc.)

2. Software to test your Python installation

   i.)  bcbm_test.py
   ii.) bcbm_test_plot1_compare.png

   These can be downloaded from the Boot Camp GitHub.
   They are a test program and sample output file provided before the 
   start of the Boot Camp.
   They are meant to check that your machine (Windows/Macintosh/Linux) 
   is set up properly to run the software necessary for this section.
   The Boot Camp overall instructions provide for installing Python
   with the Anaconda bundle. 
   It is assumed that your Anaconda installation includes the following
   Python modules : numpy, h5py, matplotlib.
   Running "bcbm_test.py" (see below) will check that they are all present
   on your machine. If they are not please install them. 
   Please note that Basemap is included with Anaconda but is not part
   of the default installation. You need to run "conda install basemap"
   as an indivdual command after the main Anaconda install.
   Once the relevant software is installed run at the prompt :

   > bcbm_test.py -v 

   If your set up is working properly expect to see something like :

   BCBM_TEST : bcbm_test_cmd_line = ['-v']
   BCBM_TEST : Program started : 2015-06-03 09:07:04.264686
   BCBM_TEST : sys.version     = 2.7.6 (default, Apr 22 2014, 11:43:50)
   [GCC 4.1.2 20080704 (Red Hat 4.1.2-54)]
   BCBM_TEST : sys.version           = 2.7.6 (default, Apr 22 2014, 11:43:50)
   [GCC 4.1.2 20080704 (Red Hat 4.1.2-54)]
   BCBM_TEST : self.verbose          = True
   BCBM_TEST : self.test_mode        = False
   BCBM_TEST : display_map1 ACTIVATED
   BCBM_TEST : Program ended : 2015-06-03 09:07:05.376743
   BCBM_TEST : Run time      : 0:00:01.112057
   BCBM_TEST : Program completed normally

   If you do not get this type of output check your Python setup,
   ammend as needed and retry.

   If "bcbm_test.py" runs properly you will find (in the same directory 
   you ran the program) an output file called "bcbm_test_plot1.png".
   This is a very basic map of the world. Compare it to the sample file
   "bcbm_test_plot1_compare.png". Expect very similar output.
   IE. A monochrome outline map of the world, eliptical shape. 

   If you are not producing the expected results 
   please check your Python installation. 

3. For the actual presentation you will need (from the Boot Camp GitHub) :

   Four demonstration source code files :

   i.)   bcbm1.py
   ii.)  bcbm2.py
   iii.) bcbm3.py
   iv.)  bcbm4.py

   Two test data files :

   i.)  bcbm_OMPS_LP_L2_test1.h5 - swath data
   ii.) bcbm_OMPS_NM_L3_test2.h5 - gridded data

   Also provided is a skeleton python program "bcbm_pyskel.py".
   This will run, though produces nominal output only.
   It is meant for you to use to develop your own software later.
   It provides a very basic program layout with command line parsing,
   function calls and clean invocation and closure.
   Like all software shown in the Basemap part of the course it can be
   run at the prompt and also imported as a module to another Python program.
   (See object orientation part of Boot Camp for further details.)
 

4. Problems for the Basemap presentation :

   Breakout session
   ----------------
   Part 1
   ------
   Make a backup copy of "bcbm4.py" (EG. bcbm4_bu1.py).
   Then modify the original "bcbm4.py" to plot satellite tracks over North America.
   Use the data from "bcbm_OMPS_LP_L2_test1.h5" - a read function for this file is 
   already provided in "bcbm4.py".
    
   Part 2
   ------
   If your home town is within the area covered by the map add it to the map,
   along with population statistics.
   If your hometown has too small a population to show up 
   (minimum size one pixel on the map) multiply its population by
   10, 100, etc. for it to show up.

   If your home town falls outside the area of the map pick a town/city
   within the map area with some significance to you and plot it accordingly.
   (If your hometown is off the map and there is nowhere of some significance 
    to you within the map borders plot the location of Anchorage, Alaska.)

   Close examination of "bcbm4.py" shows that the population of Lawrence, Kansas
   has been exaggerated by a factor of 10 so it will appear on the map.
   Why was this city included on the map ?
   Hint : Examine the map edges closely.   




   Overnight Exercize
   ------------------
   Make a backup copy of "bcbm2.py" (EG. bcbm2_bu1.py).
   Then modify the original "bcbm2.py".
   Add two input parameters :

   "-m" meridian width
   "-p" parallel width

   Alter "bcbm2.py" so that a user can change the spacing of 
   the meridians and/or parallels with the "-m" and/or "-p" parameters.
   Use the existing hard coded values as defaults.
   Include appropriate range limits on input values.
   Ensure that "bcbm2.py -h" provides appropriate help text.
