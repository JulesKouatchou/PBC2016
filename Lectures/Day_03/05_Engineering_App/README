Engineering Application
-----------------------

This lecture describes an IRAD (Internal Research and Development)
project, "CATTENS", to develop an engineering application, which is being
written in Python.

To run the jupyter notebook as a slide presentation, you should be able
to either simply execute the 'runslides.sh' file,

    ./runslides.sh

... or if that doesn't work, try copying the text out of that file
and execute it as a command:

    jupyter nbconvert cattens.ipynb --to slides --post serve --config slides_config.py
